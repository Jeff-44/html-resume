    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>My Career as a Web Devolopper</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Special dates</h3>
    <h4>2019</h4>
    <p>
      In 2019, I started with <b>C</b> programming language <br>
      because this was the language taught at the faculty. <br>
      I learned speudocode which is not a programming language <br>
      but a human language in which we explain the logic of the <br>
      core programming concepts.
    </p>
    <h4>2020</h4>
    <p>
      In 2020 it was Covid19. At that time I struggled a lot <br>
      there was no electricity in my neighborhood as a matter <br>
      of fact I had to go where ever I could to find electricity <br>
      in order to take programming courses. I introduced my self <br>
      in <b>Python</b> programming language.
    </p>

    <h4>2021</h4>
    <p>
      I remember discovered <b><em>Coursera.org</em></b> which was a wonderful<br>
      experience where I could find and take any course on my own pace
    </p>

    <h4>2022</h4>
    <p>
      I bought a course on <b>edx.org</b> the CS50'web programming by <em><b>Bryan Yu</b></em><br>
      a brilliant Havard student.
    </p>
    <h4>2023</h4>
    <p>
      Now, I am happy to take this tremendous Bootcamp by <em><b>Dr Angela Yu</b><br></em>
      I can say that she is very explicit in her explanation. And I really feel <br>
      while I am doing the exercices from the course.
      I want to congratulate <br> for the great Job that's she is doing <br>
      by training over a million people all over the world including myself
